This document lists key Typesaurus features that make it the best way to use Firestore. {% .lead %}

There're two main feature groups - type-safety, which enables data consistency, and developer experience that elevates Firestore to another level and makes it safe and fun to use.

Skip to [Philosophy & architecture](/docs/architecture) to learn about underling principles behind these features.

## General features

### Universal package

Typesaurus provides a unified API for both Web and Admin SDKs enabling seamless code sharing between server and client.

### Build size-efficiency

The package is heavily optimized and adds just 4 Kb to the build size.

## Type-safety

## Developer experience

### Centralized schema

### Single-import principle

We designed Typeusurus so that you'll, most of the time, need only one import to define the schema or use the database.

It makes the API easier to learn and eliminates _import hordes_ even on most busy modules.
